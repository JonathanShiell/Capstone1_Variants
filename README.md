# Capstone1_Versions
Versions of Capstone 1, described in Readme file.

## Version Descriptions
Versions are allocated descriptive names, rather than numbers, as they are intended to be parallel forks.

`finance_calculators_decimal.py` uses `decimal.Decimal` (as `Decimal`) from the Python Standard Library (built-in but not loaded by default) rather than the `float` type for greater accuracy.
